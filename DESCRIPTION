Description: Implements data processing described in <doi:10.1126/sciadv.abk3283> 
    to align modern differentially private data with formatting of older US Census 
    data releases. The primary goal is to read in Census Privacy Protected Microdata 
    Files data in a reproducible way. This includes tools for aggregating to relevant 
    levels of geography by creating geographic identifiers which match the US Census 
    Bureau's numbering. Additionally, there are tools for grouping race numeric 
    identifiers into categories, consistent with OMB (Office of Management and Budget) 
    classifications. Functions exist for downloading and linking to existing 
    sources of privacy protected microdata.
